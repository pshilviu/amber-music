I meant to have them distributed as containers, but ran out of time and had some CORS issues, as such I've checked the distributables for the apps in the Runnables folder.
I've also changed the communication to be on http rather than https to avoid any fun with missing certificates.  

API:  
	- Requirements dotnet Core 3.1  
	- Run Amber.Music.Api.exe or dotnet Amber.Music.Api.dll (starts on http:5000)  
	
UI:  
	- npm install angular-http-server -g  
	- from the context of the UI folder run the following command to start  
	- angular-http-server --path . -p 4200 --open (should open a browser window with the UI)


In case you want to run the application you can do so via Visual Studio:
API
	- debug in DEBUG or RELEASE configuration Amber.Music.Api profile so that it can run on http port 5000
	- in case you want to fiddle with that, the UI will need the url updating in app.settings.ts
UI
	- the usual Angular process
	- npm install -- in the root
	- ng serve -o
